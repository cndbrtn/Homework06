## Weather Dashboard

### What it does
* Searches local or global weather (depending on search terms input by user)
* Displays forcasts for today
* Displays a five day projected forcast
* Enters user search terms in local storage and retrieves them for ease of access to user

#### Challenges
* SCOPE (ugh)
* Mostly just scope
* Timestamps are weird
* Skeleton is cool but uses floats which are a bitch
